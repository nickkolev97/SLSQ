This is a repository associated with the paper titled "Si(100)-SiO_2 Trap Density Dependence on Sample Processing" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23574).

The repository contains python notebooks to generate the synthetic data, the script to train the yoloV8 model, the .yaml file that alters the yoloV8 model so it includes dropout layers, and the notebook to run inference on our real data.
